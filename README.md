# Real-Time Face Detection and Analytics Dashboard

This project is a real-time face detection and analytics system using OpenCV and MongoDB. Detected faces from webcam input are logged with timestamps into MongoDB, and insights are visualized using an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's DNN module
- Frame deduplication and intelligent logging logic
- MongoDB integration for logging face detection events
- Streamlit dashboard with:
  - Face count per minute
  - Average faces per hour
  - Date vs. hour heatmap
  - CSV export and auto-refresh

## ðŸ§  Model Used

The face detector is based on OpenCVâ€™s SSD with ResNet-10 backbone trained on the WIDER FACE dataset.
